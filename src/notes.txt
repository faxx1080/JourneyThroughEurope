Flight plan:
    May only fly once.

Steps:
1) From GSM: If user stopped at airport:
    Preconditions: movesLeft > 1; fliedAlready == false
    If fail - option disabled.
    
Then from UI:
    Enable fly button.
    Show flight map.
    Method to open cities: for each acceptable city, draw circle around it.
    Key: Green = 2
    Yellow = 4
    Uncircled: BAD.
    On click city, send to GSM REgardless.

GSM: gets sent to moveInternal -- checks those conditions. If pass, warp player
(fly him over!)
