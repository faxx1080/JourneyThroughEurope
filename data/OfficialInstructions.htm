<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Object of the Game</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The players go on a journey through Europe.
Cards are handed out which determine an ever-changing route, diffe­rent for
each player. The idea is to use skill and careful consideration to choose the
best route in order to be first home. </span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Preparation</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A dealer is chosen to hand out the cards.
The dealer can also take part in the game. Each player receives a playing
piece, a flag of the same colour and a flight plan. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The place cards are sorted into three piles
according to the colour at the top of the card. Each pile is shuffled well. The
players now receive their first place card; these are dealt as follows: the
first player receives a red one, the second green, the next yellow, the next
red and so on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The city shown on a player's first card is
both beginning and end of his/her journey. The players place their flags next
to these cities on the board. Now each player receives eight more cards. These
are dealt so that each player has a total of three cards in each colour. They
indicate the cities to be visited on the journey through Europe. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>To make it easier to find these cities,
each card is marked with a letter and a number which correspond to the grid
marked around the edges of the board. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Some place cards are illustrated, featuring
tourist attractions. These cards also have special instructions on the reverse.
Players should look at all of their cards at the beginning of the game, take
note of any instruc­tions and thereby plan the quickest and most suitable
route. A further educational aspect of the game is that the place cards are
marked on the front with the town and city names in the native language of
their country. The English name appears on the back of the cards. </span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Play</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Players throw the die in tum. The number
thrown indicates the number of cities through which the player advances. If he
lands on or passes through a city for which he holds a place card, he gives
this card to the dealer. If a six is thrown, the player may take another turn. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Players can travel in any direction, but
not backwards and forwards in the same go. They can pass any flags or playing
pieces. But only <strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>one</span></strong>
playing piece can be in one city at any given time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If a player reaches a city for which he
holds a card with special instructions, he must stop there, even if his throw
means he could normally go further. The instructions must now be carried out.
He then gives the place card to the dealer and the next person takes his turn. </span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Sea Routes</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The die is not thrown when a player crosses
the sea, as he may only travel from one harbour to another. A player may not
cross the sea as <strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>part</span></strong>
of his go. He must wait at the harbour for his next tum; extra points are lost.
</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Air Routes</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The journey can be speeded up a lot by
cleverly planned flights. There are 35 airports on the board, and all appear on
the flight plans. They are marked on both board and flight plans with a red
spot. If a player rea­ches a city with an airport and has points left to
travel, the journey can be continued by plane. This is where the flight plan
comes into play. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The flight plan is divided into six
sectors. A flight to any airport city in the same sector requires two dice points.
Four points are required to cross over into an adjoining sec­tor. A player may
only move vertically or horizontally when flying into another sector, not
diagonally. If a player is at an air­port and scores too few points to fly to
his desired destination, he may not remain at the airport. He must move on,
either by land or air, by the number he has thrown. If a player has dice points
left after his plane journey he can move on from his place of arrival. A player
may fly only once during his tum. The airport he wishes to reach must be
unoccupied, i.e. no other player's playing piece must be sitting there. If the
airport is occupied, the player must either continue to travel by land or
choose another airport to go to. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>All airport cities have special
instructions. If a player holds a card for an airport city the special
instructions on this card take prio­rity over any intentions to fly from there.
</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>End of the Game</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The last card to be handed in is that for
the city from which the journey started. The player who is first to achieve
this is the winner. If, however, there are special instructions on the player's
last card, he must carry them out first. This may mean that the player will
have to leave this place again and that he will only win if he returns in time.</span></p>
